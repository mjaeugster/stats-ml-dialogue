Statistician meets ... 
  - Machine Learner
  - "Learning from Data" Community
  - 'Statistician's machine learning'


Clashes:
 - Nonparametric methods:
   - distribution free vs. nonfixed structure of a model
   - Gaussian models often 'non-parametric': they are maximum entropy distributions (as in least information), but still parametric distributions

 - Probablistic model definition:
   - DAG in a graphical model implies the complete description of a
     probabilistic model

 - prediction vs description:
   - ML: prediction more important
   - statistician: interpretation more important

Agreements:
 - uncertainty:
   - must be acknowledged
